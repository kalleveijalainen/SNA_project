### Due to Twitter policies, Twitter user ID's can not be displayed in GitHub.
### For this reason we couldn't upload the data we gathered into the repository.

### However, with the code that is visible in the analysis.ipynb file,
### that same data can be reproduced.

### If the data is necessary to be seen to complete the mandatory
### parts of the course Introduction to Social Network Analysis,
### please contact kalle.veijalainen@student.oulu.fi or
### juho.kurula@student.oulu.fi and we can arrange something.
